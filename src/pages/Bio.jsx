      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I’m Joey Sandoval—a dedicated programmer and aspiring computer engineer with a strong foundation in software development and computer science. I graduated from Sonoma State University in 2023 with a Master of Arts and recently sharpened my full-stack skills through Oregon State University’s intensive Programming Boot Camp.

Over the past few years, I’ve built and deployed applications using JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python (Flask, Django), and cloud services. I thrive on translating complex problems into clean, maintainable code and collaborating in agile teams to deliver real-world solutions.

Driven by a deep curiosity in AI programming, I explore topics like machine learning model deployment, natural language processing, and data pipelines. Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with coding and AI applications, contributing to open-source projects, and staying current on emerging technologies.</p>
